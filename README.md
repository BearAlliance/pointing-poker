## Why

[Planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) is a useful tool for both remote and co-located teams.

Other services already exist, but they are either paid or slightly dated, with no option for self-hosting.

I wanted a completely free version to use casually, and one that could be hosted on-site for more security-conscious organizations.
